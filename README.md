vr wheel emulator to play racing games and virtually hold a wheel.

- project is inspired by this repo: https://github.com/mdovgialo/steam-vr-wheel
- function and input layout based on VRChat worlds made by https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_98c855c2-1267-454d-acd5-6623e36ba5ef

**WIP**

currently have:
 - rotation
 - trigger & axis input
 - wheel rotation
 - axis can change mode and gear-shift

todo:
 - get grip sensitivity
 - hook it up to a virtual input
 - get a GUI for left-hand modes

to build current version:
1. open in visual studio 2022, (openvr header and lib files are included)
2. build (maybe need some nuget packages, idk how that works)
